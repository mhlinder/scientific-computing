Scientific Computing for Scientists
===================================

Who needs scientific computing? The answer starts with you and ends with everyone. Put more aptly: these days, who *doesn't* need scientific computing? We're hard-pressed to find an answer. Anyone doing quantitative research can benefit from the tools and concepts of contemporary scientific computing, from professional scientists, to humanists exploring statistical methods, to hobbyists systematically exploring processing.

But what is scientific computing? Primarly, scientific computing is the use of computers to conduct science. We elaborate that scientific computing is not the use of computers as an afterthought in research, but the intelligent use of computers for organizing and processing data, and communicating the results of this empirical and simulated work. Computers are unique, powerful tools for organization and analysis, and scientific computing is the exploitation of the particular advantages of computers to aid in our ability to learn about the world around us.

We have witnessed firsthand, however, the difficulty of practicing scientific computing because the development and use of the tools of scientific computing are [heavily de-emphasized](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/) within academia. Science as it is currently practiced is often poorly organized on computers, with messy code and undocumented data the norm. We hope to make this the exception, by providing a series of suggestions for the effective practice of science on computers. We believe that science should be well-documented, reproducible and highly organized, and our suggestions below seek to make the practice of this type of science as effortless as possible.

We believe that scientific computing need not be something Professional Researches pawn off to their RAs, nor considered "dirty work," nor even be complicated or difficult. We believe scientific computing can be fun, and powerful, and provide innovative solutions to problems. When used properly, computers can do things no human can do, but it is only by spending time and energy developing computational tools, skills and understanding that computers can be used to their full potential.

We put forth here a template for conducting scientific research ("science" here defined very loosely, and involving most quantitative work) with the aid of computers. Our individual workflows differ, as do the tools we use. These should differ for you, too, tailored to your preferences, field and abilities. We seek only to present some heuristics and organizational techniques that we have found greatly increase our scientific output, and might help you, too.

We consider this a guide to Scientific Computing for Scientists, and we consider it a work in progress. Please contact us with any omissions, mistakes or comments.
