A Computational Workflow
========================
In the course of conducting scientific research, data is amassed, PDFs are read, programs are written, new data is generated, plots are made, papers get written. We believe firmly in the importance of reproducibility, but all too often, not even the original researcher can reproduce code-based results, much less a third party. This scares us, and it should scare you too. It's said that good programmers don't make more mistakes, they just know to look for them more often, and this holds in scientific computing as well: science that cannot be reproduced is hardly science at all.

The key is recognizing that you will make mistakes, and that this is OK. Everyone, in the course of research, makes mistakes. Far more important is documenting *what* you did, and how, so that you can catch those mistakes quicker. Down the line, this will have the added benefit of making your scientific computations reproducible.

What do we mean? We're talking about workflow, the intelligent design of the scientific process so that it is well-documented, transparent and reproducible. This means writing down everything you do, organizing it clearly and providing access to all steps involved in producing some results.
