Python
======

We primarily use Python in our day-to-day programming, be it simple scripting or extensive software development. Python is a great multi-purpose, fully-featured programming language. Python does it all, and does it easily. Python can reliably be your go-to language for just about any problem.

Two things are worth noting with Python, that might make another language more appropriate for you: Python is an interpreted language, and Python was not designed with science as its primary purpose.

Because Python is interpreted, some programs will run very slowly (see: heavy use of the `for` loop). This is true of any interpreted language (R, MATLAB, Stata), and most computationally intense algorithms will already be implemented very quickly; but at the margins, you might need to use C if heavy computation on very large data is time-sensitive and frequent.

Because Python was not designed specifically for science, many of the scientific features Python has are add-ons. These libraries are robust, reliable, and optimized; but they often operate with an intermediary layer between the Python interpreter and their functions. This doesn't inhibit Python's function-set; it merely means things like linear algebra aren't as direct or simple as in MATLAB, or statistical modeling requires a few more steps than in R.

If you are interested in using Python, you might check out the book _Python for Data Science_, which describes in detail many packages Python has for data analysis and scientific computing.

Python is effortless to install and manage with [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), which is oriented towards scientific computing.

Use the [iPython](http://ipython.org/) Python shell. It changed the way that we program, and provides incredibly effective interaction with your code.
